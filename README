I think( hope ) I did all the objectives.
I did near far clipping with plane clipping,
then I applied the perspective matrix and then
applied homogenous clipping.


Compilation:
    - no changes from default

premake4 clean
premake4 gmake
make
./A2

Manual:

    I set some restriction to some values:
        10 <= fov <= 50
        0 < near < far < 100

    Gnomons for both world and cube are colour coded the same way:
        red: x
        green: y
        blue: z

    Note: before you translate/rotate the cube, the two gnomons would be
    overlapping, so you only see one.

    Scaling Factor: I played around to get scaling factors that seemed
    intuitive to me.
